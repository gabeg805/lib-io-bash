# I/O Library (Bash)

## Introduction

A couple of standard input/output library functions that can be useful. Mainly
used for printing and logging.

## Install

If this file resides under your *PATH* environment variable, then in a shell
script, you can source it simply with either:

```
. "io.sh"
```

or

```
source "io.sh"
```

If it does not reside under the *PATH*, you will need to give the full or relative path to *io.sh*.

## Uninstall

Remove the file.
